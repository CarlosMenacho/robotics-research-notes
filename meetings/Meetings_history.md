- [x] Some professors's research interest
	- Harvesting 
	- Dual arm collaboration and manipulation
	- Multi-track controllers
- [x] Search for Additive building ( manipulation task, arm robotic)
	- manipulation of building blocks 
	- Adapt robotic methods for additive building 
- [x] Search state-of-the-art works for agriculture, then search for techniques 
	-  Issues that robots are currently trying to solve. (using actual methods)
- [x] Define an problem statement using robots in agriculture
- [x] Check the following papers
